## Pushed new code focused on Data Structures & Algorithms using Python, with clean logic, optimized solutions, and problem-first thinking. This repo reflects my approach to problem-solving:

clarity over cleverness

efficiency over brute force

consistency over one-offs

Building strong fundamentals, one commit at a time.
Feedback, reviews, and suggestions are always welcome.
